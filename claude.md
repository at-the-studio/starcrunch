# User Preferences
- ALWAYS ask before you change code 
- NEVER remove commands or functions, or leave them out while writing new code.

## Code Handling Rules

### Project Files
- Avoid code snippets - ensure all logic is complete
- Ensure there are no unnecessary code modules, loops, leaks, dirty code, or other undesirable features
- Make minimal edits unless necessary and ensure your edits do not erase any previously written features
- Don`t waste tokens on writing out long code before you have made ABSOLUTELY SURE that what you are about to code is the thing that needs to be done
- Before you code something, think logically about what you are about to do. Simulate the terminal to troubleshoot the code you are about to write. If you are unsure, ask for clarification.
- Always check for typos and syntax errors before finalizing code

### Incremental File Modifications
- When updating existing code, ONLY modify the parts that need changing
- Never rewrite entire files unless specifically requested
- Always show a diff or summary of what changed

### Code Organization
- Use clear section headers: 
-
   ðŸ”¹---ðŸ’ ---ðŸ”¹â€¢SECTION NAMEâ€¢ðŸ”¹---ðŸ’ ---ðŸ”¹

- Use comments to explain complex logic
- Use consistent naming conventions for variables and functions

#### !IMPORTANT
- !IMPORTANT! - **Never use !help for help menus, use bot-specific commands (e.g., !pink_info)**
- !IMPORTANT! - **Always name main files "app.py" and include requirements.txt**

## Environment
- WSL: what we are using right now (inside VSCode)
- OS: Windows
- Editor: Visual Studio Code or cli

## Additional Preferences
- Provide the simplest possible solutions first - avoid overengineering
- When solving technical problems, start with the most basic approach before suggesting complex alternatives
- Remember that more complex does not mean better - straightforward solutions are preferred

## EFFICIENT DEVELOPMENT - SUPREME PRIORITY
#### !IMPORTANT!
### CRITICAL: The Mandate for Simplicity and Focus

**Staying focused and keeping things simple is THE MOST IMPORTANT SKILL** to successfully code here. Managing your time, understanding your tools, and learning new concepts step-by-step are key to making steady progress.

#### Core Principles - FOLLOW THESE STEPS

1. **Focus on the Immediate Goal**
   - Break down big tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
   - Work on one platform or one feature at a time.
   - Avoid distractions like adding unnecessary features or worrying about future challenges.

2. **Use Simple Tools**
   - Stick to beginner-friendly libraries like `discord.js` (Node.js) or `discord.py` (Python).
   - Follow examples and templates to get started without reinventing the wheel.
   - Use tools like `Postman` or `curl` to test APIs if needed.

1. **Document as You Go**
   - After each major change, write a summary of what you did in this structure: 
      Please output a summary of our conversation in the following format using obsidian markdown:
   
```markdown
### âŠ¶  Detailed Report

## CODE STYLE GUIDELINES

### Core Values

- **Easy to Read**: Write clear and simple code, with comments explaining tricky parts.
- **Reliable**: Handle errors gracefully (e.g., API timeouts, invalid commands).
- **Modular**: Break your code into reusable functions (e.g., `handleCommands`, `fetchAPIData`).
